# Google OAuth Setup Verification

## ✅ Your Configuration

**Supabase Callback URL:** `https://tdedpxgmayzdfhjiecun.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
**Google Sign-in:** ✅ Enabled in Supabase

## 🔧 Current Setup

Your auth store is configured to redirect users to `/dashboard` after successful Google authentication, which will work perfectly with your Supabase callback URL.

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the auth page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth
   ```

3. **Click "Continue with Google"**
   - Should redirect to Google OAuth
   - After authentication, redirect back to `/dashboard`

4. **Verify the flow:**
   - User profile should be created automatically
   - Google profile picture should display
   - Full name from Google should show

## 🚀 Production Deployment

When you deploy to Vercel, the callback will automatically work with your production domain:

- **Development:** `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- **Production:** `https://your-domain.vercel.app/dashboard`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to Authentication → Providers
   - Verify Google is enabled
   - Check that your callback URL is added

2. **Check Google Cloud Console:**
   - Verify OAuth client is configured
   - Add your production domain to authorized origins
   - Ensure redirect URIs include your Supabase callback

3. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for any authentication errors
   - Verify Supabase connection

## ✨ Expected Result

Users should be able to:
- Click "Continue with Google"
- Complete Google OAuth flow
- Be redirected to dashboard
- See their Google profile information
- Access all F1 race features

Your Google OAuth setup is ready to go! 🏎️✨
